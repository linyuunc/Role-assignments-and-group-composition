**1. In Chen et al (2012)**

 This is a strategy of structuring collaborative activities in group learning (Morris et al., 2010; Strijbos et al., 2004). 
 According to Hare (1994), roles can be defined as stated or prescribed responsibilities or duties guiding individual behavior 
 and regulating collaboration. Each designated role may assume a type of task completion function,
 such as **data collector, data analyzer, leader, or coordinator, generally assigned by the researcher or instructor**.

**2. In Dillenbourg and Hong (2008)**
* Citation:https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00692019/document**
They encounter two types of roles in CSCL scripts, **‘induced’ roles and ‘natural’ roles**. Induced roles are roles proposed by the script with a low or high degree of coercion. Natural roles refer to the exploitation of differences that exist between students before entering the script. Roles can be induced by restricting access to specific resources 1)documents 2)tools or by defining specific 3)responsibilities related to student authentication in the system.

**4.The role assignments below are used ONLINE.** 
**location-based collaborative role-playing game**
* Students work in a group of two 
* Students are randomly assigned with the roles of AED support or CPR person at the scene of emergency, working on a manikin.

**5. In Romote Accessible Field Trip (RAFT)**
* The Remote Accessible Field Trip (RAFT) project is implementing a method of spanning field trip and classroom locations to provide an
integrated event for the set of pupils involved. 
* The initial roles proposed include, in the classroom: **classroom coordinator, classroom communicator, researchers and archivist and in the field: field communicator, scouts, data gatherers and annotators**.
* It is also emerging from initial prototyping that each person in a group needs a uniquely definedrole and these roles may include **researcher, communicator, analyst, collator and developer.

**6. role assignment in asynchronous discussion groups**
* starter
* theoretician
* source searcher
* moderator
* summariser

* The introduction of the roles are based on facilitator, resource person, summariser, starter, wrapper, discussion moderator, topic leader, and topic reviewer (Cohen, 1994, Hara et al., 2000, Shotsberger, 1997, Tagg, 1994).
* Description:  The starter is required to start off and give new impulses each time the discussion slacks off. The role of the moderator consists of monitoring the discussion, asking critical questions, and inquiring for others' opinions. The theoretician is asked to ensure that all relevant theoretical concepts were used in the discussion. The role of the source searcher comprises seeking external information on the discussion topics in order to stimulate other students to go beyond the scope of the course reader. The summariser is expected to post interim summaries during the discussion, focusing on identifying dissonance and harmony between the messages and drawing provisional conclusions, and a final summary at the end of the discussion.

**7. Three main categories of roles can be distinguished: individual roles, task roles, and maintenance roles**, each of which is composed
of several different roles (Mudrack & Farrell, 1995)

###  Homogeneous and Heterogeneous 
Average-ability students often do not take full advantage of learning in mixed-ability groups because they hardly engage 
in the group interaction. This study examined whether structuring collaboration by group roles and ground rules for helping 
behavior might help overcome this participatory inequality. In a plant biology course, heterogeneously grouped fourth-grade boys (n=164) 
were randomly assigned to a structured collaboration condition or an unconstrained comparison condition. Results indicated positive
effects of structured collaboration on average-ability students’ achievement, motivation, and contribution to the group interaction.
